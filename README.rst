Elv is a small utility for parsing exported CSV files from the online
Norwegian bank Jæren Sparebank.

I use it for personal purposes, but decided to simply upload the code
anyway, in case anyone wants to do the same.

If you want to contribute other formats, please send pull requests on
the project's GitHub page at

Use the "export data" feature in the online bank, and you should be able
to parse the file using Elv.

Features
--------

-  Parses CSV file from bank containing transactions
-  Money is stored in exact decimals (as you should do; never use floats
   for stuff like this)
-  Contains a simple Python query API for sorting through large
   collections of transactions.
-  Can optionally put transactions in an in-memory SQLite3 database for
   even better queries.

Norwegian short description
---------------------------

Elv er en Python modul for å lese banktransaksjoner eksportert fra
banken din som en CSV-fil. Foreløpig er det kun Jæren Sparebank som jeg
*vet* er støttet, men du kan nok ganske enkelt legge til lesere for
andre format.

Installation
------------

You can install from ``setup.py``::

    $ python setup.py install # you may have to run as sudo

or from PyPI::

    $ pip install elv

Example usage
-------------

If you have the bank account transactions in a file called ``data.csv``, you
can simply do::

    $ python
    >>> import elv
    >>> transactions = elv.parse("data.csv")
    >>> transactions
    <Transactions:400 items from 2009-01-27 to 2014-09-29>
    >>> transactions[0]
    <Transaction:2014-09-29 2014-09-29 -2677.00  29519.13 'Vacation'>
    >>> transactions[0].xfer
    datetime.date(2014, 9, 29)
    >>> transactions[0].posted
    datetime.date(2014, 9, 29)
    >>> transactions[0].amount
    Decimal('-2677.00')

You can also get an in-memory SQLite3 database by doing::

    >>> db = transactions.to_sqlite3()
    >>> db
    <sqlite3.Connection object at 0x10f31e200>
    >>> db.execute("SELECT * FROM Transactions").next()
    (0, datetime.date(2014, 9, 29), datetime.date(2014, 9, 29),
     u'Vacation', Decimal('-2677'), Decimal('29519.13'))

The CSV File Format
-------------------

The CSV file should be a plain text file with the
`ISO-8859-1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1>`__ encoding
(aka Latin1). It looks like this:

::

    "31-12-2014";"31-12-2014";"Test 1";"-497,78";"5.520,09"
    "30-12-2014";"31-12-2014";"Test 2";"-100,00";"6.017,87"
    "30-12-2014";"31-12-2014";"Test 3 --æøåÆØÅ--";"-145,47";"6.117,87"
    "30-12-2014";"30-12-2014";"Test 4";"-457,24";"6.263,34"
    "29-12-2014";"29-12-2014";"Test 5";"-108,30";"6.720,58"

The fields are as follows:

-  Date when the transaction was placed, in format ``"DD-MM-YYYY"``.
-  Date when the transaction was posted ("bokført").
-  A message associated with the transaction, set by the one making the
   transaction.
-  The amount deposited or deducted from the account in `NOK (Norwegian
   kroner) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_krone>`__ in format
   ``"-123,45"``, always two decimals and an optional sign.
-  The balance of your account after this transaction was completed.

The file itself contains no headers, and can contain many such
transactions, one per line.
